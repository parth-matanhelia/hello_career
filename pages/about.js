                        <p> Hello! We are a bunch of 16-year-olds who felt the need to create a platform where you can find your
                            passion. As a teenager or even a kid you’re always asked about what you want to become when you grow
                            up. Most of us are exposed to very few career choices and so we don’t really choose an appropriate
                            career that we are passionate about. It is completely okay to not know what you want to do or be
                            confused. We have over 300 job profiles listed out for you to make the right choice for yourself.
                            All of these career options have gone through thorough research and by the end of this journey you
                            will learn about the top universities that offer these courses in India and abroad, the maximum and
                            minimum income and mainly-<br/>your passion!</p>

                            to expect from the profession and become more confident about their choices. Where as, other career
                            counsellors tell individuals to pursue professions which they think are best for students. They
                            guide individuals based on what they think is good for them without knowing as to what the
                            individual is interested in or what they are passionate about . @HelloCareer it is all about your
